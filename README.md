# MultivariateAnalysis_SolarEnergy_2019
This is a small part of our project in exploring rooftop solar energy potentials in U.S. using different Multivariate Analysis techniques (PCA, Clustering ...).  The data was collected and generated by National Renewable Energy Laboratory.   
Our purpose in this analysis is to identify regions of the United States with higher potentials for adopting rooftop solar energy PV technology on low-income families and its characteristics through an Exploratory Data Analysis approach.
